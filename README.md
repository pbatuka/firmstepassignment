# Firmstep Assignment
Here are the files for the task you have assigned me the first page to load should be the index.html, you will need to be able to run serverside pages however, as the rest contain php. Sorry that this took a while to complete, but I initially planned to use an MVC model with gradle where I could even set up a login system and make use of repositories and controllers to access and save data from JSP pages, as I am more experienced with that, however, there seemed to be an issue with my database that I have had to contact my uni's admin about; and so resulted in me going back and attempting to make use of php I knew.
